                <h2> \ New Wave</h2>
                <p class ="about-text">
                There's this new trend of species flocking on IG reels and youtube lately, 18-25 year old dudes with rich parents, dressed up in linen shirts and beige chinos and some designer brand loafers, with 
                    their dad's credit card maxed out,
                    yapping about personal brand, building agency, digital marketing, client outreach, most probably living in Bali or Dubai. All thanks to Iman gadzi.
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                As an engineer, all those jargons sound blant with no actual depth. or maybe I am too ignorant still, idk...
                <br><br>
                PS: no offence to those creaters, they upload aesthetically good content out there.

                <h2> \ Boring path</h2>
                <p class ="about-text">
                Its always the boring problem statements that give success with very less competition in the market.
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                Compliance is such a boring domain, and nobody had an eye on that domain for such a long time, but look at Vanta ($4.15Billion valuation) which just automates security
                compliance like ISO27001, GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2 etc., most of us dont even know what these are, but these are highly funded sectors in any enterprise. Nobody talks about it
                rarely do you see these products on producthunt or X(twitter), its only when you see an article on techcruch you realise.
                  
                </p>

        <br><br>
                <h2> \ Wide angle</h2>
                <p class ="about-text">
                If you focus on the leaf, you'll miss out on the tree, if you focus on the tree, you'll miss out on the forest, if you focus on the forest, you'll miss out on
                    the mountains, rivers, birds, clouds, butterflies, when you see things, see in its entirety , thats what truly 'seeing' means.     - Takuan soho
                  
                </p>

        <br><br>
                 <h2> \ Limp</h2>
                <p class ="about-text">
                Plantar warts are the real pain in the foot!
                  
                </p>

        <br><br>
                <h2> \ Legacy</h2>
                <p class ="about-text">
                “The sword is the path to the self. When the self disappears, only the sword remains.”
— Musashi
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
            This line from the Vagabond is so much connected to the hindu philosophy, focus on the work/service, and forget about the self in that process, when the self dissapeares,
                only the work/service which you did remains in this world, thats how legacies are made.
                  
                </p>
        <br><br>
                <h2> \ Hooked to Evolution</h2>
                <p class ="about-text">
                Finished 37 volumes of Vagabond in 4 days, probably i have a problem with addictions, but I came to realisation that 
                    every man must read Vagabond atleast once in his 20s.
                  
                </p>

        <br><br>
                <h2> \ Panic or Strategic</h2>
                <p class ="about-text">
                The new $100,000 fee for h1b visa, which created a panic mode for majority of immigrant tech workers, is it patriotism or a strategy to 
                    pay of the existing 9.2 trillion$ debt?, maybe but it kind of hit two targets with one bullet.
                  
                </p>

        <br><br>
                <h2> \ Product Teardowns?</h2>
                <p class ="about-text">
                I was thinking about starting a new practice, I'll pick some product and start writing product teardowns and case studies, 
                    probably focusing on early stage start-ups...
                  
                </p>

        <br><br>
            <h2> \ AI might shape real Engineers</h2>
            <p class="about-text">
                With AI easily taking away junior level web developer/software engineering jobs, 
                its pretty obvious that, People should start looking for problems, brainstorm harder, and find innovative solution, 
                instead of grinding leetcode mindlessly just for a software engineer job, build with a  purpose, it's always good to think like a start-up founder
                and approach the problem with that mindset.
            While you have AI at your disposal, we must learn to use it efficiently, adapt to skills of the future, its high time we must learn prompt engineering
        and context engineering ,it's the ultimate key to unlock the true potential of AI.</p>

        <br><br>

                <h2> \ Delusions</h2>
                <p class ="about-text">
                It feels good to listen when they preach, be delusional, think big yada yada yada, following that mentality will sometimes motivate you in persuing wrong goal,
                and end up in the trenches. To be precise, a "controlled delusion" is what we must aim for, which is backed by data, practicality, logic and a sense of detachment.
            Pivot when its needed, fail fast, learn fast.
                  
                </p>

        <br><br>
                <h2> \ Quality vs Quantity</h2>
                <p class = "about-text">
                    It's not about how much you lift, progress is not defined by the weight lifting capacity, its how well you lift with proper form, 
                    how controlled is your breathing, how well the muscles are engaged. 
                </p>

        <br><br>

                <h2> \ Random thought</h2>
                <p class = "about-text">
                    Imagine you have your own locally hosted LLM, fine tuned on voice AI, partnered with all the telecom providers, which picks particular keywords 
                    from phone calls, and text sms, which might indicate threat to the homeland, and it marks the geo-location of that cellphone from the nearest cell tower. 
                    Next thing he sees is a Black Escalade parked outside his house.
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    Palantir, is that you? or watching too much Tom Clancy's movies got to my head.
                </p>

        <br><br>

        <h2> \ Inhale-Exhale</h2>
                <p class = "about-text">
                    2 sharp inhales, 2 sharp exhales - for each stride, that's how breathe is controlled and can push longer runs.
                </p>

        <br><br>

        <h2> \ Environment</h2>
        <p class ="about-text">
            One of the best decision so far, was moving to San Francisco, in just few months, the changes can be felt, 
            the start-up influence is real here, looking at the rate of development and innovation happening here, it felt foolish to miss out on this experience.
            Everyday there is a new idea, new acquisition, new company spawning next to you.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            The best NPCs are created in over-crowded bachelor houses, just Evacuate.
            Change the environment, surround yourself with people who are better than you.
        </p>

         <br><br>

        <h2> \ Boujee</h2>
                <p class = "about-text">
                    Using a classic fountain pen in everyday note taking rather than a regular ball point pen feels exquisite.
                </p>

        <br><br>

        <h2> \ Limitless</h2>
                <p class = "about-text">
                    Learning mandarin could be a really good investment in 2025, looking at the chinese models surpassing 
                    the westerns models, with comparatively less compute. 
                </p>

        <br><br>

        <h2> \ Quick patch</h2>
                <p class = "about-text">
                    Try white noise for 30-45  mins daily, to fix your fried dopamine receptors. 
                </p>

        <br><br>

        <h2> \ PS</h2>
                <p class = "about-text">
                    I built this with claude code, if the Email link doesn't work, feel free to dm me on linkedin.
