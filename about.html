        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p class="about-text">
                I’m an engineer who loves building and finding smarter ways to work with AI. 
                I spend a lot of time automating the little things with AI agents and sharpening my prompting skills to get better results. 
                For me, tech is not just about cutting down effort, it is about creating more space for meaningful work. Outside of screens and code, 
                I keep balance through fitness, whether that is a 5-mile jog, long walks by the beach, or chasing new personal records with pull-ups and push-ups.
                Progress, to me, is both mental and physical.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
               <p>I have worked on projects that blend problem-solving with hands-on engineering.
                At HPE Juniper Networks, I partnered with senior engineers to design and validate testbeds, 
                built automation strategies that cut release times, and even improved system reliability by reducing manual overhead. 
                Before that, as a trainee at Brigade Group, I got my start in network security, helping with vulnerability assessments, 
                compliance work, and risk analysis. Along the way I have picked up skills in Python, JavaScript, React, and lately n8n workflow automation, 
                agile practices, but what excites me most is using them to turn ideas into solutions.</p>
