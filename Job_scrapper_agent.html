        <h1>AI-Powered Job Search Automation</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p class="about-text">
                This project details the end-to-end development of a robust, AI-integrated workflow designed to revolutionize the job search 
and initial application phase. Built entirely within n8n, the automation is initiated daily by a Cron trigger, precisely set to activate at 9:00 AM. 
The core data acquisition begins with an HTTP Request node configured to interact with SerpApi, effectively bypassing common bot detection mechanisms 
to reliably scrape Google Jobs. This initial data pull is highly targeted, applying predefined filters for specific job roles  within the United States, 
and crucially, only for postings less than a week old. The raw JSON output from SerpApi is then meticulously processed: a Split Out node transforms the 
job array into individual items, followed by an Edit Fields (Set) node that standardizes field names (e.g., `title` to `jobTitle`, `link` to `jobUrl`) and 
enriches each item with a `source` identifier. A subsequent Remove Duplicates node ensures that only unique job postings from the current fetch proceed, 
preventing redundant processing.
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                The workflow then intelligently manages job tracking and personalized Cover letter. A parallel Google Sheets node retrieves all existing 
job URLs from a dedicated "Job Application Tracker" spreadsheet, which is then fed into a Merge node. This Merge node performs a crucial anti-join operation, 
filtering out any newly sourced jobs that are already present in the tracker, ensuring only truly fresh opportunities are considered. These genuinely new jobs are 
then appended as new rows to the Google Sheet, automatically setting their status to "New." Concurrently, a separate branch of the workflow focuses on daily 
reminders: it queries the Google Sheet for all jobs with a "New" status, and a Code node dynamically formats these into a compelling HTML list. 
This list is then delivered to my inbox via a Gmail node, providing a concise daily digest of actionable leads. The pinnacle of this automation is 
the AI-powered cover letter generation: for each new job appended to the sheet, an AI Agent node, integrated with OpenRouter using 
NVIDIA/nemotron-nano-9b-v2:free model , crafts a custom cover letter. This agent is provided with the job's title, company, description, 
and my full resume content (pre-loaded via an Edit Fields node), guided by a system prompt to deliver a concise and professionally signed letter. 
Finally, each generated cover letter is automatically saved as a distinct Google Doc in a specified Google Drive folder, ensuring a well-organized 
repository of tailored application materials. This comprehensive system transforms the job application process into a highly efficient, intelligent, 
and personalized experience.
